Driven by the ability of graphs to represent complex real-world data and capture intricate relationships among entities, research in graph-structured data has been rapidly growing. A core focus of this field is community detection, which involves decomposing a graph into densely connected groups --- revealing the natural structure inherent in the data. Discovering hidden communities in social networks \cite{blekanov2021detection}, analyzing regional retail landscapes \cite{verhetsel2022regional}, studying user relations in Decentralized Online Social Networks (DOSNs) \cite{la2022information}, delineating health care service areas \cite{wang2021network}, uncovering disinformation networks in Telegram \cite{la2021uncovering}, partitioning large graphs for machine learning \cite{bai2024leiden}, studying biological processes \cite{heumos2023best}\ignore{\cite{liu2024sclega, hartman2024peptide, muller2024spatialleiden}}, characterizing polarized information ecosystems\ignore{(climate change conversations)} \cite{uyheng2021mainstream}, developing cyber resilient systems\ignore{/networks by investigating cyber defense techniques} \cite{chernikova2022cyber}, identifying transportation patterns \cite{chen2023deciphering}, identifying attacks in blockchain networks \cite{erfan2023community}, examining restored accounts on Twitter \cite{kapoor2021ll}, exploring the eco-epidemiology of zoonoses \cite{desvars2024one}, analyzing linguistic variation in memes \cite{zhou2023social}, reconstructing multi-step cyber attacks \cite{zang2023attack}, studying twitter communities during the 2022 war in Ukraine \cite{sliwa2024case}, and automated microservice decomposition \cite{cao2022implementation} are all applications of community detection.

A challenge in community detection is the absence of prior knowledge about the number and size distribution of communities. To address this, researchers have developed numerous heuristics for finding communities \cite{com-blondel08, com-gregory10}\ignore{\cite{com-raghavan07, com-guimera05, com-derenyi05, com-newman06, com-reichardt06, com-rosvall08, infomap-rosvall09, com-fortunato10, com-kloster14, com-come15, com-ruan15, com-newman16, com-ghoshal19, com-rita20, com-lu20, com-gupta22}}. The quality of identified communities is often measured using fitness metrics such as the modularity score proposed by Newman et al. \cite{com-newman04}. These communities are\ignore{considered} intrinsic when identified based solely on network topology\ignore{, without external attributes}, and they are disjoint when each vertex belongs to only one community \cite{com-gregory10}.
% A core focus of this field is community detection, which involves decomposing a graph into densely connected communities. By optimizing quality measures of network connectivity, such as modularity, community detection maximizes connections within derived communities while minimizing connections between them. This clustering process reveals the natural structure inherent in the data, making it a vital area of study in network science.
% In summary, no general purpose algorithm will ever serve all applications or data types, because each perspective emphasizes a particular core aspect: a cut-based method provides good separation of balanced groups, a clustering method provides strong cohesiveness of groups with high internal density, stochastic block models provide strong similarity of nodes inside a group in terms of their connectivity profiles, and methods that view communities as dynamical building blocks aim to provide node groups that influence or are influenced by some dynamics in the same way \cite{schaub2017many}.

The Louvain method, proposed by Blondel et al. \cite{com-blondel08}\ignore{from the University of Louvain}, is one of the most popular community detection algorithms \cite{com-lancichinetti09}. This greedy algorithm employs a two-phase approach, consisting of an iterative local-moving phase and an aggregation phase, to iteratively optimize the modularity metric over several passes \cite{com-blondel08}. It has a time complexity of $O(KM)$ (where $M$ is the number of edges in the graph and $K$ is the total number of iterations performed across all passes) and efficiently identifies communities with high modularity.\ignore{What are the popular CD algorithms?}

Despite its popularity, the Louvain method has been observed to produce internally disconnected and poorly connected communities. This problem occurs during the local-moving phase, where important nodes ---\ignore{such as hubs} that serve as bridges within a community --- may be reassigned to another community to which they have stronger connections, breaking the connectivity of their original community. To address these issues, Traag et al. \cite{com-traag19}\ignore{from the University of Leiden} proposed the \textbf{Leiden algorithm}\ignore{ (which is partially based on the smart local move algorithm \cite{waltman2013smart})}, which introduces a refinement phase between the local-moving and aggregation phases. During the refinement phase, vertices can explore and potentially form sub-communities within the communities identified in the local-moving phase --- allowing the algorithm to identify well-connected communities \cite{com-traag19}.
% Note however that neither algorithms, i.e., Louvain and Leiden, can guarantee the convergence to a unique solution every time. One suggestion is to run the programs multiple times to yield a number of results, from which a best solution can be chosen \cite{wang2021network}. A few researchers have observed that the Leiden algorithm is more stable in detecting communities \cite{anuar2021comparison}. Sahu et al. \cite{sahu2024fast} have recently proposed one of the most efficient implementations of the Leiden algorithm.

But many real-world graphs are immense and evolve rapidly over time\ignore{, through the insertion and deletion of edges and vertices}. For efficiency, algorithms are needed that update results without recomputing from scratch, known as \textbf{dynamic algorithms}. Dynamic community detection algorithms also allow one to track the evolution of communities over time, identifying key events like growth, shrinkage, merging, splitting, birth, and death. However, research efforts have focused on detecting communities in dynamic networks using the Louvain algorithm. None of the works have extended these approaches to the Leiden algorithm.
% Parallel algorithms for graph analytics on dynamic graphs are an active area of research. Examples of parallel dynamic algorithms include those for updating centrality scores \cite{cent-shao20, cent-regunta21}, maintaining shortest paths \cite{path-zhang17, path-khanda21}, and dynamic graph coloring \cite{color-yuan17, color-bhattacharya18}.
% Recognizing the temporal dimension's significance, particularly in crisis scenarios, will contribute to a more nuanced understanding of community dynamics \cite{sliwa2024case}.

This paper extends the Naive-dynamic (ND) \cite{com-aynaud10}\ignore{\cite{com-chong13, com-shang14, com-zhuang19}}, Delta-screening (DS) \cite{com-zarayeneh21}, and the recently proposed parallel Dynamic Frontier (DF) approach \cite{sahu2024shared} to the Leiden algorithm.\footnote{\url{https://github.com/puzzlef/leiden-communities-openmp-dynamic}} Our algorithms build on top of GVE-Leiden \cite{sahu2024fast}, one of the most efficient shared-memory implementations of the Static Leiden algorithm.\ignore{Upon receiving a batch update comprising edge deletions and insertions, DF Leiden incrementally identifies and processes an approximate set of affected vertices in an incremental manner.} This work represents, to the best of our knowledge, the first endeavor in extending existing dynamic approaches to the Leiden algorithm.

% One straightforward strategy for dynamic community detection involves leveraging the community memberships of vertices from the previous snapshot of the graph \cite{com-aynaud10, com-chong13, com-shang14, com-zhuang19}, which we term as \textit{Naive-dynamic (ND)}. Alternatively, more sophisticated techniques have been devised to reduce computational overhead by identifying a smaller subset of the graph affected by changes. These techniques include updating only changed vertices \cite{com-aktunc15, com-yin16}, processing vertices in the proximity of updated edges (within a specified threshold distance) \cite{com-held16}, disbanding affected communities into lower-level networks \cite{com-cordeiro16}, or employing a dynamic modularity metric to recompute community memberships from scratch \cite{com-meng16}. Recently, a technique known as \textit{Delta-screening (DS)} has been proposed, which identifies a subset of vertices impacted by changes in a graph using delta-modularity \cite{com-zarayeneh21}. We have also introduced an efficient incrementally expanding approach for dynamic community detection, which we call the \textit{Dynamic Frontier (DF)} approach \cite{sahu2024dflouvain}.
% Further, a majority of the reported algorithms \cite{com-aynaud10, com-chong13, com-meng16, com-cordeiro16, com-zhuang19, com-zarayeneh21} are sequential.
