In conclusion, this report adapts three approaches for community detection in dynamic graphs --- Naive-dynamic (ND), Delta-screening (DS), and Dynamic Frontier (DF) --- to our multicore implementation \cite{sahu2023gveleiden} of the Leiden algorithm \cite{com-traag19}, which is well-known for its strong community detection performance. Our experiments on a server equipped with a 64-core AMD EPYC-7742 processor show that ND, DS, and DF Leiden achieve speedups of $1.37\times$, $1.47\times$, and $1.98\times$, respectively, on large graphs with randomized batch updates, compared to Static Leiden. When applied to real-world dynamic graphs, ND, DS, and DF Leiden show more moderate speedups of $1.07\times$, $1.10\times$, and $1.13\times$, respectively. These smaller gains are primarily because the dynamic methods reduce runtime only during the local-moving phase of the initial pass, while subsequent passes must still be executed as in Static Leiden to ensure high-modularity communities without internal disconnections. Additionally, unlike Static Leiden, ND/DS/DF Leiden enable community tracking on dynamic graphs. We hope these\ignore{initial} results encourage further investigation of dynamic Leiden algorithm\ignore{in the context of evolving graphs}.
