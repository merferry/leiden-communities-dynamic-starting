In conclusion, this report extended three approaches for community detection on dynamic graphs --- Naive-dynamic (ND), Delta-screening (DS), and Dynamic Frontier (DF) --- to our multicore implementation \cite{sahu2023gveleiden} of the Leiden algorithm \cite{com-traag19}, an algorithm renowned for its robust community detection capabilities. Our experiments conducted on a server featuring a 64-core AMD EPYC-7742 processor reveal that ND, DS, and DF Leiden achieve speedups of $1.25\times$, $1.24\times$, and $1.37\times$ respectively, when applied to large graphs with randomized batch updates, compared to Static Leiden. However, when applied to real-world dynamic graphs, ND, DS, and DF Leiden demonstrate speedups of $1.14\times$, $1.11\times$, and $1.09\times$ respectively. The relatively modest speedups are due to the dynamic approaches being capable of reducing the runtime of only the local-moving phase of the initial pass of the Leiden algorithm, while still necessitating the execution of all subsequent passes akin to Static Leiden, in order to attain high-modularity communities devoid of internal disconnections. We hope these preliminary findings motivate further exploration of dynamic approaches to the Leiden algorithm\ignore{in the context of evolving graphs}.
