In this paper, we show how to adapt three approaches for community detection in dynamic graphs --- Naive-dynamic (ND), Delta-screening (DS), and Dynamic Frontier (DF) --- to a fast multicore implementation \cite{sahu2024fast} of the Leiden algorithm \cite{com-traag19}. This enables users to track community changes over time while reducing the computational cost of updating communities as the graph evolves. Our experiments on a server equipped with a 64-core AMD EPYC-7742 CPU show that ND, DS, and DF Leiden achieve moderate speedups of $1.37\times$, $1.47\times$, and $1.98\times$, respectively, on large graphs with randomized batch updates, compared to Static Leiden. These small gains are primarily because we need to run the algorithm for several passes, similar to Static Leiden, in order to obtain high quality top-level communities, and the reduction in runtime occurs only during the local-moving and refinement phases of the first pass of the algorithm. For every doubling of threads, our algorithms scale by $1.6\times$. We hope these\ignore{initial} results encourage further investigation of dynamic Leiden algorithm\ignore{in the context of evolving graphs}.
% When applied to real-world dynamic graphs, ND, DS, and DF Leiden show more moderate speedups of $1.07\times$, $1.10\times$, and $1.13\times$, respectively.
% We plan to explore many core architectures such as GPUs in the future.
